# Dmoz-Dataset

* Since the website of dmoz if closed, the RDF dataset is not available, either. Including the download url given by the official. Fortunately, an editor hosted the dataset on the server. You can find it on the following url:

https://curlz.org/dmoz_rdf/

* The certification of the website is out-dated, so you need to add an exception to your browser. Then you can download the dataset.
Cheers!
